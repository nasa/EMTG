   handle      is the DAS file handle of a DSK file open for read
               access.  This kernel must contain a type 2 segment
               that provides a plate model representing the entire
               surface of the target body.


   dladsc      is the DLA descriptor of a DSK segment representing
               the surface of the target body.

 
   target      is the name of the target body.  `target' is
               case-insensitive, and leading and trailing blanks in
               `target' are not significant. Optionally, you may supply
               a string containing the integer ID code for the object.
               For example both &quot;MOON&quot; and &quot;301&quot; are legitimate strings
               that indicate the moon is the target body.
 
               This routine assumes that the target body's surface is
               represented using a plate model, and that a DSK file
               containing the plate model has been loaded via <a href="dasopr_c.html">dasopr_c</a>.
 

   et          is the epoch, represented  as seconds past J2000 TDB, at
               which the illumination angles are to be computed.  When
               aberration corrections are used, `et' refers to the
               epoch at which radiation is received at the observer.
 
   abcorr      indicates the aberration corrections to be applied to
               the position and orientation of the target body and the
               position of the Sun to account for one-way light time
               and stellar aberration.  See the discussion in the
               Particulars section for recommendations on how to choose
               aberration corrections.
                 
               `abcorr' may be any of the following: 
 
                  &quot;NONE&quot;     Apply no correction.  Use the geometric
                             positions of the Sun and target body
                             relative to the observer; evaluate the
                             target body's orientation at `et'.
 
               The following values of `abcorr' apply to the
               &quot;reception&quot; case in which photons depart from the
               target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
               et-lt and *arrive* at the observer's location at
               `et':
 
                  &quot;LT&quot;       Correct for one-way light time (also
                             called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) using a
                             Newtonian formulation. This correction
                             uses the position and orientation of the
                             target at the moment it emitted photons
                             arriving at the observer at `et'.  The
                             position of the Sun relative to the
                             target is corrected for the one-way light
                             time from the Sun to the target.
 
                             The light time correction uses an
                             iterative solution of the light time 
                             equation (see Particulars for details). 
                             The solution invoked by the &quot;LT&quot; option 
                             uses one iteration. 
 
                  &quot;LT+S&quot;     Correct for one-way light time and stellar
                             aberration using a Newtonian formulation.
                             This option modifies the positions
                             obtained with the &quot;LT&quot; option to account
                             for the observer's velocity relative to
                             the solar system barycenter (note the
                             target plays the role of &quot;observer&quot; in the
                             computation of the aberration-corrected
                             target-Sun vector). The result is that the
                             illumination angles are computed using
                             apparent position and orientation of the
                             target as seen by the observer and the
                             apparent position of the Sun as seen by
                             the target.
 
                  &quot;CN&quot;       Converged Newtonian light time correction.
                             In solving the light time equation, the
                             &quot;CN&quot; correction iterates until the
                             solution converges (three iterations on
                             all supported platforms).
 
                             The &quot;CN&quot; correction typically does not
                             substantially improve accuracy because the
                             errors made by ignoring relativistic
                             effects may be larger than the improvement
                             afforded by obtaining convergence of the
                             light time solution. The &quot;CN&quot; correction
                             computation also requires a significantly
                             greater number of CPU cycles than does the
                             one-iteration light time correction.
 
                  &quot;CN+S&quot;     Converged Newtonian light time 
                             and stellar aberration corrections. 

   obsrvr      is the name of the observing body.  This is typically a
               spacecraft, the earth, or a surface point on the earth.
               `obsrvr' is case-insensitive, and leading and trailing
               blanks in `obsrvr' are not significant. Optionally, you
               may supply a string containing the integer ID code for
               the object.  For example both &quot;EARTH&quot; and &quot;399&quot; are
               legitimate strings that indicate the earth is the
               observer.
 
   spoint      is a surface point on the target body, expressed in
               rectangular body-fixed (body equator and prime meridian)
               coordinates.  `spoint' need not be visible from the
               observer's location at time `et'.

               For all of the angles below, if `spoint' does not lie on
               one of the *exterior* plates comprising the DSK type 2
               surface representation, the &quot;intercept&quot; style
               &quot;sub-observer point&quot; corresponding to `spoint' is used
               in the illumination angle computations in place of
               `spoint'.  The selected point will always be on the
               *outermost* plate intersected by a ray emanating from
               the target body's center and passing through `spoint'.

               See the header of <a href="subpt_pl02.html">subpt_pl02</a> for details
               concerning the definition of the sub-observer point.
 
               In all cases, the normal vector is taken from the plate
               on which the sub-point corresponding to `spoint' lies.
               If this sub-point lies on an edge or vertex, a normal
               vector for one of the bordering plates is selected.
                            

   phase       is the phase angle at `spoint', as seen from `obsrvr' at
               time `et'.  This is the angle between the spoint-obsrvr
               vector and the spoint-sun vector. Units are radians. The
               range of `phase' is [0, pi].

 
   solar       is the solar incidence angle at `spoint', as seen from
               `obsrvr' at time `et'.  This is the angle between the
               surface normal vector at `spoint' and the spoint-sun
               vector.  Units are radians.  The range of `solar' is [0,
               pi].

 
   emissn      is the emission angle at `spoint', as seen from `obsrvr'
               at time `et'.  This is the angle between the surface
               normal vector at `spoint' and the spoint-observer
               vector.  Units are radians.  The range of `emissn' is
               is [0, pi].

   2) If either of the input body names `target' or `obsrvr' cannot be
      mapped to NAIF integer codes, the error SPICE(IDCODENOTFOUND)
      is signaled.
 
   3) If `obsrvr' and `target' map to the same NAIF integer ID codes, the

      diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call tree of this
      routine.

   8) If the computation method is &quot;near point&quot; and radii of
      the target body have not been loaded into the kernel pool, the
      error will be diagnosed and signaled by routines in the call tree

       SPICE(TARGETMISMATCH) is signaled.

   11) If the segment associated with the input DLA descriptor is not
       of data type 2, the error SPICE(WRONGDATATYPE) is signaled.

   12) If the sub-point associated with `spoint' cannot be computed 
       because the line segment from a suitably scaled-up `spoint' to
       the target body's center fails to intersect the target surface
       as defined by the plate model, the error SPICE(NOINTERCEPT) is
       signaled.  See the routine <a href="subpt_pl02.html">subpt_pl02</a> for details.

   13) Use of transmission-style aberration corrections is not
       permitted.  If abcorr specified such a correction, the 
       error SPICE(NOTSUPPORTED) is signled.

   14) The observer is presumed to be outside the target body; no

       will be signaled.
 
   16) If any input string has length zero, the error SPICE(EMPTYSTRING)
       will be signaled.

   the data are made available by loading kernels; however the
   data may be supplied via subroutine interfaces if applicable.
 
   The following data are required:
 
   The following data are required:
 
      - DSK data:  a DSK file containing a plate model representing the
        target body's surface must be loaded. This kernel must contain
        a type 2 segment that contains data for the entire surface of
        the target body.

      - SPK data:  ephemeris data for target, observer, and Sun must be
        loaded.  If aberration corrections are used, the states of
        target and observer relative to the solar system barycenter
        must be calculable from the available ephemeris data. Typically
        ephemeris data are made available by loading one or more SPK
        files via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>.
 
      - PCK data:  triaxial radii for the target body must be loaded
        into the kernel pool if the &quot;Near Point&quot; method is selected.
        Typically these data are made available by loading a text PCK
        file via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>.
 
      - Further PCK data:  rotation data for the target body must
        be loaded.  These may be provided in a text or binary PCK file.
        Either type of file may be loaded via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>.

      - Frame data:  if a frame definition is required to convert
        the observer and target states to the body-fixed frame of
        the target, that definition must be available in the kernel
        pool.  Typically the definition is supplied by loading a
        frame kernel via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>. 
 
   In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program
   run, NOT every time this routine is called.

   The term &quot;illumination angles&quot; refers to following set of 
   angles: 
 
 
      solar incidence angle    Angle between the surface normal at the
                               specified surface point and the vector
                               from the surface point to the Sun.
 
      emission angle           Angle between the surface normal at the
                               specified surface point and the vector
                               from the surface point to the observer.
 
      phase angle              Angle between the vectors from the
                               surface point to the observing body and
                               from the surface point to the Sun.
 
 
   The diagram below illustrates the geometric relationships defining
   these angles.  The labels for the solar incidence, emission, and
   phase angles are &quot;s.i.&quot;, &quot;e.&quot;, and &quot;phase&quot;.

    location           to viewing 
    (observer)         location 
 

   Note that if the target-observer vector, the target normal vector
   at the surface point, and the target-sun vector are coplanar, then
   phase is the sum of incidence and emission.  This is rarely true;
   usually 

      phase angle  &lt;  solar incidence angle + emission angle

 
   All of the above angles can be computed using light time 
   corrections, light time and stellar aberration corrections, or 
   no aberration corrections.  The way aberration corrections 
   are used is described below. 
 
   Care must be used in computing light time corrections.  The 
   guiding principle used here is &quot;describe what appears in 
   an image.&quot;  We ignore differential light time; the light times 
   from all points on the target to the observer are presumed to be 
   equal. 
 
 
      Observer-target body vector 
      --------------------------- 
 
      Let `et' be the epoch at which an observation or remote 
      sensing measurement is made, and let et - lt (&quot;lt&quot; stands 
      for &quot;light time&quot;) be the epoch at which the photons received 
      at `et' were emitted from the body (we use the term &quot;emitted&quot; 
      loosely here). 
 
      The correct observer-target vector points from the observer's 
      location at `et' to the target body's location at et - lt. 
      The target-observer vector points in the opposite direction. 
 
      Since light time corrections are not symmetric, the correct 
      target-observer vector CANNOT be found by computing the light 
      time corrected position of the observer as seen from the 
      target body. 
 
 
      Target body's orientation 
      ------------------------- 
 
      Using the definitions of `et' and `lt' above, the target 
      body's orientation at et - lt is used.  The surface 
      normal is dependent on the target body's orientation, so 
      the body's orientation model must be evaluated for the correct 
      epoch. 
 
 
      Target body -- Sun vector 
      ------------------------- 
 
      All surface features on the target body will appear in a
      measurement made at `et' as they were at the target at epoch
      et-lt.  In particular, lighting on the target body is dependent
      on the apparent location of the Sun as seen from the target body
      at et-lt.  So, a second light time correction is used in finding
      the apparent location of the Sun.

 
   Stellar aberration corrections, when used, are applied as follows: 
 
 
      Observer-target body vector 
      --------------------------- 
 
      In addition to light time correction, stellar aberration is 
      used in computing the apparent target body position as seen 
      from the observer's location at time `et'.  This apparent 
      position defines the observer-target body vector. 
 
 
      Target body-Sun vector 
      ---------------------- 
 
      The target body-Sun vector is the apparent position of the Sun, 
      corrected for light time and stellar aberration, as seen from 
      the target body at time et-lt.  Note that the target body's 
      position is not affected by the stellar aberration correction 
      applied in finding its apparent position as seen by the 
      observer. 
 
 
   Once all of the vectors, as well as the target body's 
   orientation, have been computed with the proper aberration 
   corrections, the element of time is eliminated from the 
   computation.  The problem becomes a purely geometric one, 
   and is described by the diagram above.

   The numerical results shown for this example may differ across
   platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input,
   the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine specific
   arithmetic implementation.
 
   In the following example program, the file

      phobos.3.3.bds

   is a DSK file containing a type 2 segment that provides a plate model 
   representation of the surface of Phobos.  The file
 
      mar085.bsp
 
   is a binary SPK file containing data for Phobos, the Earth, and the
   Sun for a time interval bracketing the date
    
      2006 NOV 3 00:00:00 UTC.
 
   pck00009.tpc is a planetary constants kernel file containing radii
   and rotation model constants.  naif0009.tls is a leapseconds kernel.
 
   All of the kernels other than the DSK file should be loaded via
   a meta-kernel.  An example of the contents of such a kernel is:

       \begindata

          KERNELS_TO_LOAD = ( 'naif0009.tls'
                              'pck00009.tpc'
                              'mar085.bsp' )
       \begintext

   Find the illumination angles at both the sub-observer point and
   sub-solar point on Phobos as seen from Earth for a specified
   sequence of times. Perform each computation twice, using both the
   &quot;intercept&quot; and &quot;ellipsoid near point&quot; options for the sub-observer
   point and sub-solar point computations. Compute the corresponding
   illumination angles using an ellipsoidal surface for comparison.

   1) This routine assumes that the origin of the body-fixed reference 
      frame associated with the target body is located in the interior
      of that body.
 
   2) This routine does not compute illumination angles for surface
      points on interior plates, for example plates representing
      the interior of a cave or tunnel.  See the Detailed Output
      header section above.

   3) Illumination angles on an irregular target body surface may
      differ greatly from those on a reference ellipsoid for the same
      surface, as illustrated by the example program shown above.
      Users may want to consider using the ellipsoid formulation of
      this algorithm, which is implemented in the CSPICE routine
