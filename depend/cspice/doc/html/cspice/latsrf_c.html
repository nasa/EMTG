   method      is a short string providing parameters defining 
               the computation method to be used. In the syntax 
               descriptions below, items delimited by brackets 
               are optional. 
               
               `method' may be assigned the following values:    
 
                  &quot;ELLIPSOID&quot; 
  
                     The surface point computation uses a triaxial 
                     ellipsoid to model the surface of the target 
                     body. The ellipsoid's radii must be available 
                     in the kernel pool. 
 
 
                  &quot;DSK/UNPRIORITIZED[/SURFACES = &lt;surface list&gt;]&quot; 
 
                     The surface point computation uses topographic 
                     data to model the surface of the target body. 
                     These data must be provided by loaded DSK 
                     files. 
 
                     The surface list specification is optional. The 
                     syntax of the list is 
 
                        &lt;surface 1&gt; [, &lt;surface 2&gt;...] 
 
                     If present, it indicates that data only for the 
                     listed surfaces are to be used; however, data 
                     need not be available for all surfaces in the 
                     list. If absent, loaded DSK data for any surface 
                     associated with the target body are used. 
 
                     The surface list may contain surface names or 
                     surface ID codes. Names containing blanks must 
                     be delimited by double quotes, for example 
 
                        SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot; 
                                        
                     If multiple surfaces are specified, their names 
                     or IDs must be separated by commas. 
 
                     See the Particulars section below for details 
                     concerning use of DSK data. 
 
 
               Neither case nor white space are significant in 
               `method', except within double-quoted strings. For 
               example, the string &quot; eLLipsoid &quot; is valid. 
 
               Within double-quoted strings, blank characters are 
               significant, but multiple consecutive blanks are 
               considered equivalent to a single blank. Case is  
               not significant. So 
 
                  &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot; 
 
               is equivalent to  
 
                  &quot; mars megdr  128  pixel/deg &quot; 
 
               but not to 
 
                  &quot;MARS MEGDR128PIXEL/DEG&quot; 
  
                
   target      is the name of the target body. `target' is 
               case-insensitive, and leading and trailing blanks in 
               `target' are not significant. Optionally, you may 
               supply a string containing the integer ID code for 
               the object. For example both &quot;MOON&quot; and &quot;301&quot; are 
               legitimate strings that indicate the Moon is the 
               target body. 
 
               When the target body's surface is represented by a 
               tri-axial ellipsoid, this routine assumes that a 
               kernel variable representing the ellipsoid's radii is 
               present in the kernel pool. Normally the kernel 
               variable would be defined by loading a PCK file. 
 
 
   et          is the epoch for which target surface data will be 
               selected, if the surface is modeled using DSK data. 
               In this case, only segments having time coverage that 
               includes the epoch `et' will be used. 
 
               `et' is ignored if the target is modeled as an 
               ellipsoid. 
 
               `et' is expressed as TDB seconds past J2000 TDB. 
 
                                 
   fixref      is the name of a body-fixed reference frame centered 
               on the target body. `fixref' may be any such frame 
               supported by the SPICE system, including built-in 
               frames (documented in the Frames Required Reading) 
               and frames defined by a loaded frame kernel (FK). The 
               string `fixref' is case-insensitive, and leading and 
               trailing blanks in `fixref' are not significant. 
 
               The output surface points in the array `srfpts' will be 
               expressed relative to this reference frame. 
 
 
   npts        is the number of coordinate pairs in the array `lonlat'. 
 
 
   lonlat      is an array of pairs of planetocentric longitudes and 
               latitudes of surface points. Elements 
 
                  lonlat[0][i]
                  lonlat[1][i]
 
               are, respectively, the planetocentric longitude and 
               latitude of the Ith surface point, where `i' ranges 
               from 0 to npts-1.
 
               The units of longitude and latitude are radians.

   srfpts      is an array of target body surface points 
               corresponding to the pairs of coordinates in the 
               input `lonlat' array. Elements 
 
                  srfpts[0][i]
                  srfpts[1][i]
                  srfpts[2][i]
 
               are the Cartesian coordinates, expressed in the
               reference frame designated by `fixref', of the surface
               point corresponding to the Ith pair of input
               coordinates, where `i' ranges from 0 to npts-1.
 
               If there are multiple solutions for a given input 
               coordinate pair, this routine will return the point 
               at those coordinates having the greatest distance 
               from the origin of the coordinate system.

   1)  If the target body name 
       input string cannot be converted to an integer ID code, the 
       error SPICE(IDCODENOTFOUND) is signaled. 
 
   2)  If the input target body-fixed frame `fixref' is not 
       recognized, the error SPICE(NOFRAME) is signaled. A frame 
       name may fail to be recognized because a required frame 
       specification kernel has not been loaded; another cause is a 
       misspelling of the frame name. 
 
   3)  If the input frame `fixref' is not centered at the target body, 
       the error SPICE(INVALIDFRAME) is signaled. 
 
   4)  If data are not available to convert between the frame 
       `fixref' and the frame of a DSK segment of interest, the error 
       will be signaled by a routine in the call tree of this 
       routine. 
 
   5)  If the input argument `method' cannot be parsed, the error 
       will be signaled either by this routine or by a routine in 
       the call tree of this routine. 
 
   6)  If the computation method specifies an ellipsoidal target 
       model, and if triaxial radii of the target body have not been 
       loaded into the kernel pool prior to calling <b>latsrf_c</b>, the 
       error will be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call 
       tree of this routine. 
 
   7)  The target must be an extended body: if the computation 
       method specifies an ellipsoidal target model, and if any of 
       the radii of the target body are non-positive, the error will 
       be signaled by routines in the call tree of this routine. 
 
   8)  If `method' specifies that the target surface is represented by 
       DSK data, and no DSK files are loaded for the specified 
       target, the error is signaled by a routine in the call tree 
       of this routine. 
        
   9)  If `method' specifies that the target surface is represented 
       by DSK data, and data representing the portion of the surface 
       corresponding to the coordinates provided in `lonlat' are not 
       available, an error will be signaled by a routine in the call 
       tree of this routine. 
 
  10)  If a surface point cannot be computed because the ray 
       corresponding to a longitude/latitude pair fails to intersect 
       the target surface as defined by the plate model, the error 
       SPICE(NOINTERCEPT) is signaled. 
 
  11)  If the surface point corresponding to a longitude/latitude 
       pair in `lonlat' does not have matching longitude and latitude 
       (because it is on the opposite side of the origin), the error 
       SPICE(SHAPENOTSUPPORTED) is signaled. 
 
  12)  If any input string argument pointer is null, the error
       SPICE(NULLPOINTER) will be signaled.

  13)  If any input string argument is empty, the error 
       SPICE(EMPTYSTRING) will be signaled.

   Appropriate kernels must be loaded by the calling program before 
   this routine is called. 
 
   The following data are required: 
 
      - Shape data for the target body: 
               
          PCK data:  
 
             If the target shape is modeled as an ellipsoid, 
             triaxial radii for the target body must be loaded into 
             the kernel pool. Typically this is done by loading a 
             text PCK file via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>. 
 
          DSK data:  
 
             If the target shape is modeled by DSK data, DSK files 
             containing topographic data for the target body must be 
             loaded. If a surface list is specified, data for at 
             least one of the listed surfaces must be loaded. 
 
      - Target body orientation data: these may be provided in a 
        text or binary PCK file. In some cases, target body 
        orientation may be provided by one more more CK files. In 
        either case, data are made available by loading the files 
        via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>. 
 
   The following data may be required: 
 
      - Frame data: if a frame definition is required to convert  
        between the body-fixed frame of the target and the frame of 
        a DSK segment providing topographic data, that definition 
        must be available in the kernel pool. Typically the 
        definition is supplied by loading a frame kernel via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>. 
 
      - Surface name-ID associations: if surface names are specified 
        in `method', the association of these names with their 
        corresponding surface ID codes must be established by  
        assignments of the kernel variables 
 
           NAIF_SURFACE_NAME 
           NAIF_SURFACE_CODE 
           NAIF_SURFACE_BODY 
 
        Normally these associations are made by loading a text 
        kernel containing the necessary assignments. An example of 
        such a set of assignments is 
 
           NAIF_SURFACE_NAME += 'Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG' 
           NAIF_SURFACE_CODE += 1                     
           NAIF_SURFACE_BODY += 499 
 
      - SCLK data: if the target body's orientation is provided by 
        CK files, an associated SCLK kernel must be loaded. 
 
   In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program 
   run, NOT every time this routine is called.

   This routine is intended to be used for target body surfaces that 
   have a unique radius for each pair of planetocentric longitude 
   and latitude coordinates. 
 
   If the target surface is represented by topographic data, it is 
   possible for there to be multiple surface points at a given 
   planetocentric longitude and latitude. For example, this can 
   occur if the surface has features such as cliffs, caves, or 
   arches. 
 
   For more complex surfaces, the routine 
 
      DSKSXV {DSK, ray-surface intercept, vectorized} 
 
   may be more suitable. That routine works with rays having vertices 
   anywhere outside of the target body. 
 
 
   Planetocentric coordinates 
   ========================== 
 
   Planetocentric longitude and latitude are defined as follows: 
 
      Longitude of a point P is the angle between the prime meridian 
      and the meridian containing P. The direction of increasing 
      longitude is from the +X axis towards the +Y axis. 
  
      Latitude of a point P is the angle from the XY plane of the 
      ray from the origin through the point. 
 
 
   Using DSK data 
   ============== 
 
      DSK loading and unloading 
      ------------------------- 
 
      DSK files providing data used by this routine are loaded by 
      calling <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a> and can be unloaded by calling <a href="unload_c.html">unload_c</a> or 
      <a href="kclear_c.html">kclear_c</a>. See the documentation of <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a> for limits on numbers 
      of loaded DSK files. 
 
      For run-time efficiency, it's desirable to avoid frequent 
      loading and unloading of DSK files. When there is a reason to 
      use multiple versions of data for a given target body---for 
      example, if topographic data at varying resolutions are to be 
      used---the surface list can be used to select DSK data to be 
      used for a given computation. It is not necessary to unload 
      the data that are not to be used. This recommendation presumes 
      that DSKs containing different versions of surface data for a 
      given body have different surface ID codes. 
 
 
      DSK data priority 
      ----------------- 
 
      A DSK coverage overlap occurs when two segments in loaded DSK 
      files cover part or all of the same domain---for example, a 
      given longitude-latitude rectangle---and when the time 
      intervals of the segments overlap as well. 
 
      When DSK data selection is prioritized, in case of a coverage 
      overlap, if the two competing segments are in different DSK 
      files, the segment in the DSK file loaded last takes 
      precedence. If the two segments are in the same file, the 
      segment located closer to the end of the file takes 
      precedence. 
 
      When DSK data selection is unprioritized, data from competing 
      segments are combined. For example, if two competing segments 
      both represent a surface as sets of triangular plates, the 
      union of those sets of plates is considered to represent the 
      surface.  
 
      Currently only unprioritized data selection is supported. 
      Because prioritized data selection may be the default behavior 
      in a later version of the routine, the UNPRIORITIZED keyword is 
      required in the `method' argument. 
 
       
      Syntax of the METHOD input argument 
      ----------------------------------- 
 
      The keywords and surface list in the `method' argument 
      are called &quot;clauses.&quot; The clauses may appear in any 
      order, for example 
 
         DSK/&lt;surface list&gt;/UNPRIORITIZED 
         DSK/UNPRIORITIZED/&lt;surface list&gt; 
         UNPRIORITIZED/&lt;surface list&gt;/DSK 
 
      The simplest form of the `method' argument specifying use of 
      DSK data is one that lacks a surface list, for example: 
 
         &quot;DSK/UNPRIORITIZED&quot; 
 
      For applications in which all loaded DSK data for the target 
      body are for a single surface, and there are no competing 
      segments, the above string suffices. This is expected to be 
      the usual case. 
 
      When, for the specified target body, there are loaded DSK 
      files providing data for multiple surfaces for that body, the 
      surfaces to be used by this routine for a given call must be 
      specified in a surface list, unless data from all of the 
      surfaces are to be used together. 
 
      The surface list consists of the string 
 
         SURFACES = 
 
      followed by a comma-separated list of one or more surface 
      identifiers. The identifiers may be names or integer codes in 
      string format. For example, suppose we have the surface 
      names and corresponding ID codes shown below: 
 
         Surface Name                              ID code 
         ------------                              ------- 
         &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot;                1 
         &quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;                 2 
         &quot;Mars_MRO_HIRISE&quot;                         3 
 
      If data for all of the above surfaces are loaded, then 
      data for surface 1 can be specified by either 
 
         &quot;SURFACES = 1&quot; 
 
      or 
 
         &quot;SURFACES = \&quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG\&quot;&quot; 
 
      Double quotes are used to delimit the surface name because 
      it contains blank characters.  
          
      To use data for surfaces 2 and 3 together, any 
      of the following surface lists could be used: 
 
         &quot;SURFACES = 2, 3&quot; 
 
         &quot;SURFACES = \&quot;Mars MEGDR  64 PIXEL/DEG\&quot;, 3&quot; 
 
         &quot;SURFACES = 2, Mars_MRO_HIRISE&quot; 
 
         &quot;SURFACES = \&quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG\&quot;, Mars_MRO_HIRISE&quot; 
        
      An example of a `method' argument that could be constructed 
      using one of the surface lists above is 
 
         &quot;DSK/UNPRIORITIZED/SURFACES = \&quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG\&quot;, 3&quot;
