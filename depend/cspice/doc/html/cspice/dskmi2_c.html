   nv          is the number of vertices belonging to the input 
               set of plates. 
 
  
   vrtces      is an array of coordinates of the vertices. Vertex
               indices, also called &quot;vertex numbers,&quot; are 1-based in
               all languages supported by SPICE, and range from 1 to
               `nv'. The ith vertex occupies elements [i-1][0:2] of
               this array.
 
 
   np          is the number of plates in the input plate set. 
 
 
   plates      is an array representing the triangular plates of a
               shape model. The elements of `plates' are vertex
               indices; vertex indices, as well as plate indices, are
               1-based in all languages supported by SPICE. The vertex
               indices of the ith plate occupy elements [i-1][0:2] of
               this array.
 
 
   finscl      is the fine voxel scale. This scale determines the 
               edge length of the cubical voxels comprising the fine 
               voxel grid: the edge length `voxsiz' is approximately 
                
                   finscl * {average plate extent} 
 
               where the extents of a plate are the respective 
               differences between the maximum and minimum 
               coordinate values of the plate's vertices. 
                
               The relationship between `voxsiz' and the average plate 
               extent is approximate because the `voxsiz' is adjusted 
               so that each dimension of the fine voxel grid is an 
               integer multiple of the coarse voxel scale. 
 
               See the Particulars section below for further  
               information on voxel scales. 
     
 
   corscl      is the coarse voxel scale. This integer scale is the
               ratio of the edge length of coarse voxels to that of
               fine voxels. The coarse scale must be large enough so
               that the total number of coarse voxels does not exceed
               SPICE_DSK02_MAXCGR (see the Parameters section below).
 
 
   worksz      is the second dimension of the workspace array `work'. 
               `worksz' must be at least as large as the greater of 
                
                  - the number of fine voxel-plate associations 
 
                    This number is equal to 
 
                       np * {average number of fine voxels  
                             intersected by each plate} 
 
                  - the number of vertex-plate associations, if 
                    the vertex-plate mapping is constructed. 
  
                    This number is equal to 
 
                       nv + ( 3 * np ) 
                     
 
   voxpsz      is the size of the fine voxel-plate pointer array. 
               This array maps fine voxels to lists of plates that 
               intersect those voxels. `voxpsz' must be at least as 
               large as 
 
                        3 
                  corscl  * {number of non-empty coarse voxels} 
 
 
   voxlsz      is the size of the fine voxel-plate list array. This 
               array contains, for each non-empty fine voxel, the 
               count of plates that intersect that voxel and the 
               IDs of those plates. `voxlsz' must be at least as large 
               as 
 
                       `np' * {average number of fine voxels  
                             intersected by each plate} 
                   
                   +   {number of non-empty fine voxels} 
 
 
   makvtl      is a logical flag that, when set to SPICETRUE, indicates 
               that a  vertex-plate association list is to be 
               constructed. 
 
               The amount of workspace that is needed may depend on 
               whether a vertex-plate association list is 
               constructed. When this list is constructed, the size 
               of the integer component of the spatial index is 
               increased by the size of the list and the size of a 
               vertex-plate pointer array; the total of these sizes 
               is 
 
                  ( 2 * nv ) + ( 3 * np ) 
 
 
   spxisz      is the declared size of the output array SPAIXI. This 
               size must be at least as large as the sum of 
 
                  - the fixed-size part of the integer component of 
                    the index, which includes the coarse voxel grid; 
                    this value is  
 
                       SPICE_DSK02_IDXFIX 
 
                  - the size `voxpsz' of the voxel-plate pointer array 
 
                  - the size `voxlsz' of the voxel-plate association 
                    list 
     
               plus, if the vertex-plate association list is 
               constructed, 
 
                  - the size `nv' of the vertex-plate pointer array 
      
                  - the size of the vertex-plate association list;  
                    this size is 
 
                       nv + ( 3 * np ) 
                
                 
   work        is the workspace array. The array should be declared

   Users planning to create DSK files should consider whether the  
   SPICE DSK creation utility MKDSK may be suitable for their needs. 
 
   This routine supports use of the DSK type 2 segment writer <a href="dskw02_c.html">dskw02_c</a>
   by creating the &quot;spatial index&quot; arrays required as inputs to that
   routine.
 
   A spatial index is a group of data structures that facilitates 
   rapid high-level computations involving sets of plates. The data 
   structures created by this routine are aggregated into arrays 
   of type SpiceInt and type SpiceDouble.  
 
 
   Voxel grids 
   =========== 
 
   A key geometric computation---probably the most important, as it 
   serves as a foundation for other high-level computations---is 
   finding the intersection of a ray with the plate set. DSK type 2 
   segments use data structures called &quot;voxel grids&quot; as part of 
   their indexing mechanism. There is a &quot;coarse grid&quot;: a box that 
   completely encloses a DSK type 2 segment's plate set, and which 
   is composed of identically-sized cubes called &quot;coarse voxels.&quot; 
   Each coarse voxel in composed of smaller cubes called &quot;fine 
   voxels.&quot; When the term &quot;voxel&quot; is used without qualification, it 
   refers to fine voxels. 
 
   Type 2 DSK segments contain data structures that associate plates 
   with the fine voxels intersected by those plates. These 
   structures enable the type 2 DSK software to rapidly find plates 
   in a given region of space. 
 
   Voxel scales 
   ============ 
    
   There are two voxel scales: 
 
      - The coarse voxel scale is the integer ratio of the 
        edge length of a coarse voxel to the edge length of 
        a fine voxel 
 
      - The fine voxel scale is the double precision ratio 
        of the edge length of a fine voxel to the average 
        extent of the plates in the input plate set. &quot;Extents&quot; 
        of a plate are the absolute values of the differences  
        between the respective maximum and minimum X, Y, and Z 
        coordinates of the plate's vertices. 
 
   Voxel scales determine the resolution of the voxel grid.  
   Voxel scales must be chosen to satisfy size constraints and 
   provide reasonable plate lookup performance. 
 
   The following considerations apply to spatial indexes of 
   type 2 DSK segments: 
 
      1)  The maximum number of coarse voxels is fixed at 
          SPICE_DSK02_MAXCGR (declared in SpiceDSK.h). 
 
      2)  If there are too few fine voxels, the average number of 
          plates per fine voxel will be very large. This largely 
          negates the performance improvement afforded by having an 
          index. Also, the number of plates per voxel may exceed 
          limits imposed by DSK subroutines that use static arrays. 
 
      3)  If there are too many fine voxels, the average number of 
          voxels intersected by a given plate may be too large for 
          all the plate-voxel associations to be stored. In 
          addition, the time needed to examine the plate lists for 
          each voxel (including the empty ones) may become quite 
          large, again negating the value of the index. 
         
   In many cases, voxel scales yielding optimum performance must be 
   determined by experiment. However, the following heuristics can 
   provide reasonable starting values: 
 
      Let `np' be the number of plates. Let `fs' be the fine voxel 
      scale. Then a reasonable value of `fs' may be 
 
                 (0.25) 
         fs =  np       / 8. 
 
      In general, `fs' should not smaller than 1.

   The numerical results shown for this example may differ across 
   platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as 
   input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine  
   specific arithmetic implementation.  
 
   1) Create a three-segment DSK file using plate model data for
