   handle      is the DAS file handle of a DSK file open for read
               access.  This kernel must contain a type 2 segment
               that provides a plate model representing the entire
               surface of the target body.

   dladsc      is the DLA descriptor of a DSK segment representing
               the surface of a target body.

   trmtyp      is a string indicating the type of terminator to
               compute:  umbral or penumbral.  The umbral terminator is
               the boundary of the portion of the target surface in
               total shadow. The penumbral terminator is the boundary
               of the portion of the surface that is completely
               illuminated.  Note that in astronomy references, the
               unqualified word &quot;terminator&quot; refers to the umbral
               terminator.  Here, the unqualified word refers to either
               type of terminator.

               To compute the terminator points, this routine first
               computes a set of points on the terminator of the
               indicated type on the surface of a reference ellipsoid
               for the target body.  Each such point defines the
               direction of a ray emanating from the target center and
               associated with a terminator point on the actual surface
               defined by the plate model.  The outermost surface
               intercept of each such ray is a considered to be a
               terminator point of the surface defined by the plate
               model.

               Possible values of `trmtyp' are 
 
                  &quot;UMBRAL&quot;  
                  &quot;PENUMBRAL&quot; 
 
               Case and leading or trailing blanks in `trmtyp' are 
               not significant. 
 
 
   source      is the name of the body acting as a light source. 
               `source' is case-insensitive, and leading and trailing 
               blanks in `target' are not significant. Optionally, you 
               may supply a string containing the integer ID code 
               for the object.  For example both &quot;SUN&quot; and &quot;10&quot; are 
               legitimate strings that indicate the Sun is the light 
               source. 
 
               This routine assumes that a kernel variable 
               representing the light source's radii is present in 
               the kernel pool.  Normally the kernel variable would 
               be defined by loading a PCK file. 
 
               The shape of the light source is always modeled as a 
               sphere, regardless of whether radii defining a 
               triaxial ellipsoidal shape model are available in the 
               kernel pool.  The maximum radius of the body is used 
               as the radius of the sphere. 
 
 
   target      is the name of the target body. `target' is
               case-insensitive, and leading and trailing blanks in
               `target' are not significant. Optionally, you may supply
               a string containing the integer ID code for the object.
               For example both &quot;MOON&quot; and &quot;301&quot; are legitimate strings
               that indicate the moon is the target body.
 
               This routine assumes that a kernel variable representing
               the target's radii is present in the kernel pool.
               Normally the kernel variable would be defined by loading
               a PCK file.
 
 
   et          is the epoch of participation of the observer, 
               expressed as ephemeris seconds past J2000 TDB: `et' is 
               the epoch at which the observer's position is 
               computed. 
 
               When aberration corrections are not used, `et' is also 
               the epoch at which the position and orientation of the 
               target body and position of the light source are 
               computed. 
 
               When aberration corrections are used, `et' is the epoch 
               at which the observer's position relative to the solar 
               system barycenter is computed; in this case the 
               position and orientation of the target body are 
               computed at et-lt or et+lt, where `lt' is the one-way 
               light time between the target body's center and the 
               observer, and the sign applied to `lt' depends on the 
               selected correction. See the description of `abcorr' 
               below for details. 
 
 
   fixref      is the name of the reference frame relative to which 
               the output terminator points are expressed. This must 
               a body-centered, body-fixed frame associated with the 
               target.  The frame's axes must be compatible with the 
               triaxial ellipsoidal shape model associated with the 
               target body (normally provide via a PCK): this 
               routine assumes that the first, second, and third 
               axis lengths correspond, respectively, to the x, y, 
               and z-axes of the frame designated by `fixref'. 
 
               `fixref' may refer to a built-in frame (documented in 
               the Frames Required Reading) or a frame defined by a 
               loaded frame kernel (FK). 
 
               The orientation of the frame designated by `fixref' is 
               evaluated at epoch of participation of the target 
               body.  See the descriptions of `et' and `abcorr' for 
               details. 
 
 
   abcorr      indicates the aberration correction to be applied 
               when computing the observer-target position, the 
               orientation of the target body, and the target- 
               source position vector.  `abcorr' may be any of 
               the following. 
 
                  &quot;NONE&quot;     Apply no correction.  Compute the  
                             terminator points using the position 
                             of the light source and target, and 
                             the orientation of the target, at `et'. 
 
               Let `lt' represent the one-way light time between the 
               observer and the target body's center. The following 
               values of `abcorr' apply to the &quot;reception&quot; case in 
               which photons depart from the target body's center at 
               the light-time corrected epoch et-lt and *arrive* at 
               the observer's location at `et': 
 
 
                  &quot;LT&quot;       Correct for one-way light time (also 
                             called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) using a 
                             Newtonian formulation. This correction 
                             yields the location of the terminator 
                             points at the approximate time they 
                             emitted photons arriving at the 
                             observer at `et' (the difference between 
                             light time to the target center and 
                             light time to the terminator points 
                             is ignored). 
  
                             The light time correction uses an 
                             iterative solution of the light time 
                             equation. The solution invoked by the 
                             &quot;LT&quot; option uses one iteration. 
 
                             The target position as seen by the 
                             observer, the position of the light 
                             source as seen from the target at 
                             et-lt, and the rotation of the target 
                             body, are corrected for light time. 
 
                  'LT+S'     Correct for one-way light time and 
                             stellar aberration using a Newtonian 
                             formulation. This option modifies the 
                             positions obtained with the &quot;LT&quot; option 
                             to account for the observer's velocity 
                             relative to the solar system 
                             barycenter.  This correction also 
                             applies to the position of the light 
                             source relative to the target.  The 
                             result is the apparent terminator as 
                             seen by the observer. 
 
                  &quot;CN&quot;       Converged Newtonian light time 
                             correction.  In solving the light time 
                             equation, the &quot;CN&quot; correction iterates 
                             until the solution converges.  The 
                             position and rotation of the target 
                             body and the position of the light 
                             source relative to the target are 
                             corrected for light time. 
 
                  'CN+S'     Converged Newtonian light time 
                             and stellar aberration corrections. 
 
 
   obsrvr      is the name of the observing body.  This is typically 
               a spacecraft, the Earth, or a surface point on the 
               Earth.  `obsrvr' is case-insensitive, and leading and 
               trailing blanks in `obsrvr' are not significant. 
               Optionally, you may supply a string containing the 
               integer ID code for the object.  For example both 
               &quot;EARTH&quot; and &quot;399&quot; are legitimate strings that indicate 
               the Earth is the observer. 
 
                   
   npoints     is the number of terminator points to compute.

   trgepc      is the &quot;target epoch.&quot;  `trgepc' is defined as follows: 
               letting `lt' be the one-way light time between the 
               target center and observer, `trgepc' is either the 
               epoch et-lt or `et' depending on whether the requested 
               aberration correction is, respectively, for received 
               radiation or omitted. `lt' is computed using the 
               method indicated by `abcorr'. 
 
               `trgepc' is expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB. 
 
 
   obspos      is the vector from the center of the target body at 
               epoch `trgepc' to the observer at epoch `et'.  `obspos' is 
               expressed in the target body-fixed reference frame 
               `fixref', which is evaluated at `trgepc'. 
 
               `obspos' is returned to simplify various related 
               computations that would otherwise be cumbersome.  For 
               example, the vector `xvec' from the observer to the 
               Ith terminator point can be calculated via the call 
 
                  <a href="vminus_c.html">vminus_c</a> ( trmpts[i], obspos, xvec );
 
               The components of `obspos' are given in units of km. 
 
 
   trmpts      is an array of points on the umbral or penumbral
               terminator of the target, as specified by the input
               argument `trmtyp'.  The ith point is contained in the
               array elements
 
                   trmpts[i][j],  j = 0, 1, 2

               As described above, each terminator point lies on a ray
               emanating from the center of the target and passing
               through a terminator point on the target's reference
               ellipsoid. Each terminator point *on the reference
               ellipsoid* is the point of tangency of a plane that is
               also tangent to the light source. These associated
               points of tangency on the light source have uniform
               distribution in longitude when expressed in a
               cylindrical coordinate system whose Z-axis is the
               target-source vector. The magnitude of the separation in
               longitude between the tangency points on the light
               source is
 
                  2*Pi / npoints  
 
               If the reference ellipsoid for the target is spherical,
               the terminator points also are uniformly distributed in
               longitude in the cylindrical system described above.  If
               the reference ellipsoid of the target is non-spherical,
               the longitude distribution of the points generally is
               not uniform.
                                       
               The terminator points are expressed in the body-fixed 
               reference frame designated by `fixref'.  Units are km. 
 
 
   plateIDs    is an array of integer ID codes of the plates on which
               the terminator points are located.  The ith plate ID
               corresponds to the ith terminator point. These ID codes can
               be use to look up data associated with the plate, such
               as the plate's vertices or outward normal vector.
 
               `plateIDs' should be declared by the caller

   Appropriate DSK, SPK, PCK, and frame kernels must be loaded by the 
   calling program before this routine is called.  
 
   The following data are required: 
 
      - DSK data:  a DSK file containing a plate model representing the
        target body's surface must be loaded. This kernel must contain
        a type 2 segment that contains data for the entire surface of
        the target body.

      - SPK data: ephemeris data for target, observer, and light 
        source must be loaded. If aberration corrections are used, 
        the states of all three objects relative to the solar system 
        barycenter must be calculable from the available ephemeris 
        data. Typically ephemeris data are made available by loading 
        one or more SPK files via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>. 
 
      - PCK data: triaxial radii for the target body and 
        the light source must be loaded into the kernel pool. 
        Typically this is done by loading a text PCK file via 
        <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>. 
 
      - Further PCK data:  rotation data for the target body must 
        be loaded.  These may be provided in a text or binary PCK 
        file.  
 
      - Frame data:  if a frame definition is required to convert 
        the observer and target states to the target body-fixed 
        frame designated by `fixref', that definition must be 
        available in the kernel pool.  Typically the definitions of 
        frames not already built-in to SPICE are supplied by loading 
        a frame kernel. 
 
   In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program 
   run, NOT every time this routine is called.

   In this routine, we use the term &quot;umbral terminator&quot; to denote 
   the curve usually called the &quot;terminator&quot;:  this curve is the 
   boundary of the portion of the target body's surface that lies in 
   total shadow. We use the term &quot;penumbral terminator&quot; to denote 
   the boundary of the completely illuminated portion of the 
   surface. 
 
   Boundaries of illuminated regions on an arbitrary surface are often
   complicated point sets:  boundaries of shadows of mountains and
   craters, if present, all contribute to the overall set.  To make the
   terminator computation tractable, we simplify the problem by using a
   reference ellipsoid for guidance.  We compute a set of terminator
   points on the reference ellipsoid for the target body, then use
   those points to define the latitudes and longitudes of terminator
   points on the surface defined by the specified triangular shape
   model.  As such, the set of terminator points found by this routine
   is just an approximation. 

   Below we discuss the computation of terminator points on the target
   body's reference ellipsoid. 

   This routine assumes a spherical light source.  Light rays are
   assumed to travel along straight lines; refraction is not modeled.

   Points on the reference ellipsoid at which the entire cap of 
   the light source is visible are considered to be completely 
   illuminated. Points on the ellipsoid at which some portion 
   (or all) of the cap of the light source are blocked are 
   considered to be in partial (or total) shadow. 
 
   In general, the terminator on an ellipsoid is a more complicated 
   curve than the limb (which is always an ellipse).  Aside from 
   various special cases, the terminator does not lie in a plane. 
 
   However, the condition for a point X on the ellipsoid to lie on 
   the terminator is simple:  a plane tangent to the ellipsoid at X 
   must also be tangent to the light source.  If this tangent plane 
   does not intersect the vector from the center of the ellipsoid to 
   the center of the light source, then X lies on the umbral 
   terminator; otherwise X lies on the penumbral terminator.

   1)  Compute sets of umbral and penumbral terminator points on Phobos
       as seen from Mars. Perform a consistency check using the solar
       incidence angle at each point, where the solar incidence angle
       is computed using both a reference ellipsoid and the actual
       plate model surface and surface normal.  We expect to see a
       solar incidence angle of approximately 90 degrees.  Since the
       solar incidence angle is measured between the local outward
       normal and the direction to the Sun, the solar incidence angle
       at an umbral (penumbral) terminator point should be greater than
       (less than) 90 degrees by approximately the angular radius of
       the Sun as seen from each terminator point.

                   the current terminator point.  Subtracting (adding)
                   this value from (to) the solar incidence angle for
                   umbral (penumbral) terminator points should yield a
                   value close to 90 degrees.  This provides a sanity
                   check on the locations of the terminator points.

   -CSPICE Version 1.0.0, 22-FEB-2017 (NJB) 

      Include file references have been updated. Integer output
      format in the example program has been updated.

      An error in the Detailed_Output header section was corrected.
      The text now states that the central axis of the cylindrical
      system is the target-source vector.

      29-APR-2014 (NJB)  

         Bug fix: added <a href="chkout_c.html">chkout_c</a> call after call to edterm_.

         Bug fix: corrected module name used in check-in and
         check-out calls.

         Bug fix: added error handling for null input string
         pointers and empty strings.

         Changed name of argument `fixfrm' to `fixref'.

      14-MAY-2010 (NJB)  

         Updated kernels in example program.

      12-FEB-2010 (NJB)  

         This routine now calls the CSPICE routine

            edterm_

         instead of
     
            edterm_pl02__

         This routine was updated to include

            SpiceDSK.h
            pl02.h

         The header example has been updated to use current
         planetary and satellite SPK files.
